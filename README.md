# Alphabet List
Uses the linked list data structure to represent the letters of the alphabet. The program uses LinkedCart's as the nodes for the linked list, each cart containing one letter. Programming this, I learned the basic properties of a linked list, successfully putting this knowledge to the test with this program.

This was a project for the CS 300: Programming II course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, taught by Prof. Laura Legault.
